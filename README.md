# Reflective Portfolio – Personal, Academic & Professional Development
This repository contains two core reflective components completed as part of my professional development at Kingston University: a self-interview exploring my past experiences and identity, and a critical appraisal focused on my present skills, graduate attributes, and progression pathway.


## 🚀 Component 1: Self‑Interview (Past Reflection)
This section reflects on my journey, motivations, strengths, and long‑term vision.


## 🌱 Component 2: Critical Appraisal (Present Reflection)
This component evaluates my current skills, selected graduate attributes, and how professional experiences shape my readiness for industry.
